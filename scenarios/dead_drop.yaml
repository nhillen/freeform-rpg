# Opening narration (for first turn)
opening_text: |
  The rain comes down in sheets, turning the alley into a river of neon reflections. You found Jin where Viktor said he'd be—behind the Neon Dragon, near the dumpsters. But Jin's not waiting for you. Jin's not waiting for anyone anymore.

  The body is slumped against the wall, cheap cybernetics still flickering with residual charge. No obvious wounds, but the way his eyes are fixed on nothing tells you enough. Neural overload. Someone fried his brain.

  The package isn't here.

  Your credstick has 500 on it, your neural interface is pinging Viktor asking for status, and somewhere in this rain-soaked city, whoever killed Jin might already know you were supposed to be here.

  What do you do?
