**Source:** prep_tips.txt (The Alexandrian)

This is a short document primarily about human GM prep. Most of it concerns managing limited human prep time.

## Applicable Concepts

### The Prep Progression
Suggested learning path for human GMs:
1. Five Room Dungeon (simple location-based)
2. Larger locations with "Xandering" (active monsters)
3. Adversary Roster (enemies act independently of locations)
4. Non-location-based methods (Three Clue Rule, Node-Based, Don't Prep Plots)

**AI Relevance:** This progression isn't needed for the AI, but it shows the *evolution* of GM thinking from static → dynamic → situation-based.

### Don't Over-Prep

> "I think it's really important to NOT use published adventures as an example of how to prep: Professional adventure writers are trying to communicate their vision to you. If you're prepping notes for yourself, however, you can trust your creative instincts in the moment."

**AI Implementation:** The scenario data shouldn't be over-specified. Provide the situation, let the AI fill details.

### Details Are Overrated

> "Rule of thumb: Details are overrated (with the proviso that essential details and awesome details should always be jotted down)."

**AI Implementation:** Store:
- Essential facts (what MUST be true)
- Awesome details (what makes this memorable)
- Skip: Exhaustive catalogs of room contents, NPC schedules, etc.

### Time-Value of Prep

> "Another rule of thumb: If you're spending more time prepping it than your players spend playing it, you're probably doing something wrong."

**AI Relevance:** The AI generates in real-time, so this isn't a constraint. But the principle suggests: don't generate elaborate content the player won't experience.

## Concepts to Discard

### Location-Based Prep Method
The specific advice about numbered rooms and keys is for dungeoncrawl prep.

### Stat Block Reuse
Advice about using generic monster stats. No mechanical stats in freeform.

### Physical Prep Management
Binders, maps, notation systems for table use.

## Summary

This document is mostly about human time management. The key insight for AI GM is philosophical: **trust instincts over exhaustive specification**.

The AI should have:
- Clear situation definition
- Key NPCs with motivations
- Essential facts and cool details
- Freedom to fill gaps in the moment
