# Adventure Design

## The Three Clue Rule

Justin Alexander's foundational essay addresses the persistent challenge of running mystery scenarios in tabletop RPGs. Players often derail investigations by missing clues, misinterpreting evidence, or pursuing unexpected leads, causing adventures to stall or collapse.

### Core Principle

**The Three Clue Rule states:** "For any conclusion you want the PCs to make, include at least three clues." Alexander explains that the first clue typically gets missed, the second ignored, and the third misinterpreted—yet having multiple pathways ensures the narrative continues despite player choices.

### Key Problems Identified

Mystery scenarios fail because:
- Each clue contains multiple "chokepoints" (discovery, attention, interpretation, application)
- GMs struggle objectively assessing clue obviousness
- Red herrings compound the difficulty without necessity
- Single-path designs create unrecoverable dead ends

### Solutions Offered

**Breadcrumb Trail Problems:** The GUMSHOE system guarantees clue discovery but feels mechanical and reduces player agency.

**Permissive Clue-Finding:** Embrace player creativity by accepting unconventional investigation methods that yield useful information, treating prepped solutions as safety nets rather than requirements.

**Proactive Clues:** When players stall, introduce active complications—assassins, additional deaths, or advancing villain plans—that provide new investigation opportunities.

**Red Herring Caution:** Players naturally generate suspicions without deliberate misdirection; intentional red herrings typically backfire by obscuring essential information.

### Extended Applications

The principle applies beyond mysteries to any "chokepoint problem" requiring advancement. For secret doors, locked passages, or critical discoveries, provide multiple solution paths—mechanical, environmental, social, and circumstantial—rather than single success criteria.

### Practical Implementation

Checklist approach:
- List each desired conclusion
- Identify three+ supporting clues per conclusion
- Remain open to alternative investigative approaches
- Track which clues get discovered
- Adjust proactively if patterns indicate insufficient evidence reaching players

## Don't Prep Plots

Justin Alexander's foundational essay argues that Game Masters should prepare **situations** rather than **plots** for RPG sessions.

### Core Distinction

A plot is "the sequence of events in a story" that unfolds in a predetermined order. A situation is simply "a set of circumstances" where outcomes depend on player actions rather than GM design.

### Key Problems with Plot Prep

Alexander identifies a critical weakness: plot-based preparation creates "a chain of potential points of failure." Each plot point depends on players making specific choices. When they don't, GMs face pressure to railroad players back onto the intended path.

The irony? Plot prep actually requires *more* work than situation prep, despite appearing more organized.

### Situation-Based Alternatives

**Three Clue Rule**: For critical conclusions, include at least three independent clues so players can find information even if they miss some paths.

**Goal-Oriented Opponents**: Rather than scripting villain reactions, understand what antagonists are trying to accomplish and let them pursue those goals logically.

**Know Your Toolkit**: Prepare resources (NPCs, locations, equipment, information) without pre-determining their exact deployment. Use these flexibly based on how players engage.

### Key Principle

"When the PCs choose to do X or Y or Z (or A or B or C), you don't need a pre-programmed reaction. You're sitting right there at the table with them. You can just react."

### Bottom Line

Situation-based prep empowers player choice while reducing preparation burden—the opposite of what many GMs assume.

## Don't Prep Plots: The Principles of RPG Villainy

Justin Alexander challenges the common GM practice of railroading players to ensure a predetermined villain outcome. He argues this approach undermines the satisfaction of victory and risks redirecting player frustration from the NPC antagonist toward the GM themselves.

### Three-Pronged Approach to Memorable Villains

**1. Build Tension Without Direct Confrontation**
Use minions, off-screen villainy, and social interactions to establish rivalry. As Alexander notes, "taunting communiques and phone calls" work effectively without forcing player encounters.

**2. Prepare Multiple Antagonists**
Don't pre-invest in a single "big villain." Assume the PCs will kill any antagonist they can, and develop whichever ones survive into major threats organically.

**3. Enable Strategic Retreats**
Most NPCs should attempt escape when losing fights. This simple rule creates natural villain progression—the ones who escape become your campaign's memorable antagonists.

### The Crucial Inversion

Rather than predetermined villainy, *the antagonist who survives becomes your major villain*. This transforms emergent narrative into organic rivalry.

### Table Examples

- **Silion**: Quick death despite heavy foreshadowing provided players with satisfying payoff
- **Arveth**: A minor mook transformed into a memorable nemesis through repeated escapes
- **Wuntad**: Deliberately designed encounter still allowed for unpredictable outcomes through supporting cast

The approach respects player agency while enabling engaging antagonism.

## Don't Prep Plots: Tools, Not Contingencies

Justin Alexander argues that game masters should prepare "tools" rather than "contingencies" when designing RPG scenarios. While his earlier essay emphasized prepping situations instead of plots, this piece addresses a common mistake: GMs who understand this concept at the macro level still waste time preparing multiple contingencies for every possible player action at the micro level.

### Key Distinction

Alexander uses the *Eternal Lies* hospital escape sequence to illustrate the problem. The published material extensively details specific escape methods (disguises, medicine checks, forged papers) players might attempt. His revised approach strips this to essentials: hospital layout, NPC capabilities, security positions, and the cult's existing security measures.

### The Tool vs. Contingency Framework

Tools are reusable elements answering "what exists in this situation?" Contingencies are pre-written responses assuming specific player choices. As Alexander explains, "whatever work you're putting into trying to figure out the myriad tactics the PCs might employ...you'd be far better off making your toolbox larger and more interesting."

### Identifying Useful Tools

Two guiding questions determine what deserves prep time:

1. What will genuinely interest the players?
2. What are the NPCs actually doing (their existing plans and security measures)?

This approach enables improvisation: when players propose unexpected solutions, the GM uses established tools to determine logical outcomes rather than scrambling through unused contingencies.

## Don't Prep Plots: Prepping Scenario Timelines

Justin Alexander demonstrates practical scenario preparation techniques using a detailed example from his campaign "In the Shadow of the Spire." The article illustrates how game masters can plan dynamic, responsive storylines rather than rigid plot rails.

### Core Concept

Alexander advocates creating **scenario timelines**—detailed sequences of events that would occur if players take no action. He explains: "If the PCs do absolutely nothing, these are the events that happen, culminating on 9/20/790 with the complex settling into a new status quo."

### Key Methodology

**Initial Timeline**: The author outlines what various cultist factions would do independently across several days, establishing baseline world developments.

**Revised Timeline**: When players disrupted events significantly, Alexander created a second timeline reflecting altered circumstances. He used strikethrough text for completed events while tracking ongoing developments, allowing quick reference during sessions.

### Important Principles

The approach differs fundamentally from traditional "plot prep" because it focuses on **NPC actions and consequences** rather than forcing specific player confrontations. Timelines track only details players might encounter or that affect visible world state.

Alexander notes he wouldn't plan beyond when "a new status quo" emerges, expecting player intervention would reshape everything anyway.

### Practical Application

This system enables GMs to:
- React authentically to player choices
- Maintain consistent NPC behavior
- Track world changes over time
- Avoid railroading while preserving narrative coherence

## Node-Based Scenario Design – Part 1: The Plotted Approach

Justin Alexander's essay critiques the traditional linear approach to RPG adventure design, where narratives follow a predetermined sequence of scenes (A→B→C). While this "plotted approach" offers simplicity and control, it creates significant problems.

### Key Problems Identified

**Lack of Flexibility**: The author explains that "every arrow on the plotted flow-chart is a chokepoint" that stops the adventure if players deviate. Even when using the Three Clue Rule, designers risk over-explaining the plot, potentially frustrating players who feel spoon-fed.

**Undermines Player Agency**: Linear plots demand that "the PCs must follow the arrows." Any choices deviating from the predetermined path break the game's functionality, making meaningful player decisions impossible.

### Core Argument

Alexander argues that designers should "prep situations" rather than plots. This philosophical shift acknowledges that RPGs involve active player participation—players aren't audience members following a scripted narrative but active agents making meaningful choices.

The essay introduces node-based design as an alternative framework, promising greater flexibility and player agency through interconnected locations, NPCs, and clues that allow multiple paths through scenarios rather than forcing a single sequence.

---

## Advanced Node-Based Design – Part 1: Moving Between Nodes

Justin Alexander explores how players transition between nodes in scenario design, introducing the concepts of "push" and "pull" mechanics.

### Key Concepts

**Push vs. Pull Framework**

Alexander distinguishes between two movement types:

- **Pull**: Players are drawn to explore a node because they desire something—treasure, information, or other benefits. As he explains, "a 'pull' happens when the players _want_ to explore, experience, or discover a node."

- **Push**: Players are compelled toward a node through force or circumstance, whether through threats, ambushes, or simple discovery. Players may lack knowledge about what awaits them.

### Core Insights

The article emphasizes that node-based design overcomes "gravity"—the natural resistance to exploration. This gravity takes multiple forms: player apathy, competition between different objectives, or known dangers that make exploration costly.

Alexander notes these mechanics aren't binary; motivations layer together, creating complex navigation patterns. Pushes don't require railroading—they simply create consequences within a responsive world.

## 5 Node Mystery

Justin Alexander presents a practical framework for designing mystery scenarios in tabletop role-playing games. The 5 Node Mystery is a streamlined alternative to the 5 Room Dungeon structure, specifically tailored for investigative adventures.

### Core Structure

The framework consists of five interconnected elements:

1. **Define the Mystery**: Establish the central problem—"Was someone murdered? Was something stolen?"

2. **Establish the Hook**: Determine how players discover the mystery, typically through "the scene of the crime" or similar entry point.

3. **Plan the Conclusion**: Designate Node E as the location where "they learn the ultimate answers and/or get into a big fight with the bad guy."

4. **Create Three Locations**: Brainstorm multiple compelling locations or NPCs related to the mystery, then select the three strongest as Nodes B, C, and D.

5. **Connect With Clues**: Link these nodes using a diagram where "Node A points you in three different directions" and "those three locations point to each other and also point towards the big conclusion."

### Key Principles

Alexander emphasizes flexibility: "the precise structure of the 5 Node Mystery is easy to modify on the fly." He warns against direct clue paths from the initial node to conclusion, and notes that skipped nodes can evolve into subsequent adventures.

### Campaign Expansion

The framework scales to a 5×5 structure by designing five separate mysteries arranged in the same node pattern, creating interconnected campaign arcs where seemingly unrelated investigations reveal deeper connections.

---

## Xandering the Dungeon

Justin Alexander's foundational essay introduces "xandering"—a term describing non-linear dungeon design principles pioneered by Jennell Jaquays in classic modules like *Caverns of Thracia* and *Dark Tower*.

### Core Concept

The term captures dungeon design emphasizing multiple entrances, interconnected passages, and secret routes that enable varied player experiences. Alexander argues that "dungeons should always be heavily xandered" because this approach creates genuine exploration opportunities rather than linear railroad-style progression.

### Key Design Principles

**Multiple Access Points**: Jaquays' *Caverns of Thracia* features three separate entrances to the first level with eight additional unconventional paths descending to lower levels.

**Player Agency**: Unlike linear dungeons forcing predetermined paths, xandered designs let players "chart their own course. They can retreat, circle around, rush ahead" and experience "the thrill of truly exploring the dungeon complex."

**Complexity Without Difficulty**: Alexander contends that "the complexity of a xandered dungeon emerges from the same simple structures" as linear designs—rooms with exits—so running them is no more challenging for Game Masters.

### Comparative Analysis

The article contrasts *Caverns of Thracia* with *Keep on the Shadowfell* (D&D 4e's introductory adventure), diagnosing the latter as excessively linear, which "eliminates true exploration" and "can significantly inhibit the players' ability to make meaningful strategic choices."

---

## Better Dungeon Maps – Part 1: Opening Doors

Justin Alexander examines how dungeon map design can be improved by encoding practical information directly onto maps, starting with door representations. While modern maps are aesthetically superior to those from decades past, they haven't necessarily become more functional. Alexander argues that including details about door swing direction would enhance utility without significant added complexity.

### The Problem with Doors

Players frequently ask which direction doors open when encountering them during gameplay. Rather than making ad-hoc decisions, encoding this information on maps ensures consistency across multiple sessions. "Which way does it open?" becomes answerable at a glance rather than requiring DM judgment calls that may contradict previous sessions.

### Proposed Solutions

Alexander presents several notation options:

**Option 1: Arc Method** — A curved line showing the door's swing path, based on architectural blueprint conventions. This remains Alexander's preferred approach for visibility and clarity on actual maps.

**Option 2: Simplified Angle** — Removes the arc, leaving only a directional line, though potentially less visible on crowded maps.

**Option 3: Elvis Door** — A triangular shape; Alexander questions its intuitiveness, noting ambiguity about which end represents the hinge.

**Option 4: Arrow** — Simple directional arrow showing swing without indicating hinge location.

---

## Types of Dungeons

Justin Alexander's essay categorizes dungeons by structural characteristics that affect gameplay design and execution, rather than by setting or inhabitants alone.

### Core Concept: Expedition-Based Play

The foundation of dungeon crawling involves parties gathering resources (hit points, spells, supplies) before venturing forth to achieve specific goals. Players strategically maximize returns on their investment by accomplishing as much as possible before exhausting resources and withdrawing to resupply. This creates meaningful tactical decisions.

### Four Dungeon Categories

**Micro-Dungeons**: Feature one or two significant encounter rooms plus a few minor scenic areas, totaling roughly five rooms maximum. These complete in under one session and work well as individual scenes within larger adventures or as rapid-fire quests bundled together.

**Mid-Range/Session Dungeons**: Contain approximately 10-20 rooms (five featured, equal scenic) and resolve within a single session. Players typically complete these in one expedition, though short rests may become relevant during play.

**Large Dungeons**: Three times bigger than session dungeons with 30+ rooms requiring multiple expeditions across several sessions. These enable sophisticated exploration techniques and introduce restocking mechanics, making "simple solutions" insufficient.

**Megadungeons**: Campaign-sized structures with enough content supporting multiple character progression tiers. Notably, they cannot be fully cleared, requiring alternative goals beyond "clear the dungeon" and containing multiple independent or semi-independent scenarios.

### Secondary Distinction: Lair vs. Balkanized

**Lairs** feature unified factions working together, while **balkanized dungeons** contain multiple competing groups. Balkanized designs support faction-based gameplay, allowing players to navigate political complexities and defeat the dungeon through strategic alliances rather than frontal assaults.

## How to Prep a Module

Justin Alexander presents a comprehensive guide to preparing published roleplaying game adventures for use in campaigns. He emphasizes that published adventures serve as valuable creative resources when properly integrated into a campaign world.

### Reading the Adventure

The foundational step requires reading the entire adventure cover-to-cover. While reading, Alexander recommends noting ideas for presentation elements—how to describe encounters, NPC mannerisms, puzzle mechanics, and other theatrical considerations. He frames this as imagining "presentation" rather than planning specific outcomes or contingencies.

After reading, two critical questions emerge:

1. Is the adventure worth running?
2. Does it require remixing?

### Adventure Notes Organization

Alexander uses Word documents coded alphanumerically (like "1.3 Los Angeles" or "NOD4 Temple of Deep Chaos") to organize prep materials. He maintains dedicated campaign directories with subdirectories for specific adventures and resource types.

A key technique involves treating prep notes as a "diff doc"—recording only modifications to the published text rather than rewriting entire sections.

### Reincorporating Campaign Lore

Published adventures gain coherence when integrated with existing campaign elements. Alexander recommends recasting adventure NPCs using established campaign characters, which maintains a manageable cast size while allowing character development. He references Neel Krishnaswami's "Law of the Conservation of NPCs" as supporting this practice.

### Universal NPC Templates

Significant characters benefit from structured formatting using the Universal NPC Roleplaying Template, which consolidates crucial information for easy reference during gameplay.

### Customizing the Scenario Hook

The scenario hook transforms generic adventure prompts into personally meaningful challenges. By connecting adventure premises to existing campaign events, NPC relationships, and player character backgrounds, GMs create cohesive narrative experiences.

---

## How to Remix an Adventure

Justin Alexander establishes that remixing published adventures requires a foundational reason: "There has to be a reason to remix the adventure in the first place." The adventure must contain genuinely excellent material worth enhancing. He warns against attempting to salvage fundamentally flawed content, stating that "your time would be better spent creating an original adventure."

### Two Remix Approaches

**Expansive Remixes** focus on adding substantial new content while preserving the core material. His *Eternal Lies* remix exemplifies this, contributing 300+ props, 150+ diorama elements, and two complete new adventures.

**Design Remixes** address structural deficiencies. These correct how adventures deliver their content to players, fixing broken mechanics rather than adding material.

### Adding Content Strategically

Alexander recommends maintaining a notebook while reading adventures to capture inspiring ideas before they're forgotten. One effective technique involves converting vague descriptions into tangible props—transforming "the PCs find a letter" into an actual written document.

### Fixing Structural Problems

Most published adventures suffer from inadequate structural design. Alexander identifies three core scenario structures: railroads, dungeoncrawls, and mysteries. Many poorly-designed mysteries actually function as railroads because designers misunderstand mystery construction.

For mysteries, he recommends applying the **Three Clue Rule**: "For any conclusion you want the PCs to make, include at least three clues."

### Removing Railroads

The primary remix technique involves identifying and eliminating predetermined plot sequences. By removing linear quest chains—where NPCs dispense tasks sequentially—designers can implement **node-based scenario design**, granting players meaningful choices and strategic agency.

## Strip-Mining Adventure Modules

Alexander addresses a common dismissal of published adventure modules, countering two main criticisms: that they're for uncreative people, and that they're inherently poor quality.

Despite owning more modules than he could use in a lifetime, Alexander continues purchasing them because he consistently finds value even in flawed products.

### The Tier System

Alexander establishes a utility classification:

- **Tier One**: Ready-to-use scenarios requiring minimal customization (examples: *Caverns of Thracia*, *Death in Freeport*, *Rappan Athuk*)

- **Tier Two**: Modules using 80-90% of original content with significant revision (examples: *The Night of Dissolution*, *Tomb of Horrors*, *Beyond the Mountains of Madness*)

- **Tier Three**: Fundamentally flawed but containing "specific elements that can be stripped out and reused"

- **Tier Four & Five**: Products too compromised for extraction

### The Strip-Mining Approach

Even deeply flawed products yield valuable resources:

- Usable cave system maps
- Stat blocks for adventuring companies
- Mini-systems with random terrain generation
- Multiple illustrations repurposable as handouts
- New monsters and spells
- Detailed mapped locations
- Various stat blocks and encounter tables

# Game Structures

## Game Structures

Justin Alexander identifies two fundamental questions every game designer and GM must answer:

1. "What do the characters do?"
2. "How do the players do it?"

Alexander argues these questions seem simple but require complex answers that are critical to successful gaming sessions.

### The Problem with Overlooking Structure

Many GMs treat resolution too casually. Alexander illustrates this with an example where a player's vague statement ("I want to explore the dungeon") gets resolved with a single check, collapsing meaningful gameplay into abstraction.

The author emphasizes that identical settings and systems can support radically different character types—"monarchs, dragons, farmers, magical researchers" and others—depending on the underlying game structure chosen.

### Board Games vs. RPGs

Traditional board and card games have rigidly defined structures answering "What should I do now?" at every moment. RPGs differ fundamentally because they're "functionally open-ended," allowing players to attempt virtually anything.

### Structure Determines Play

Alexander demonstrates how the same mechanics produce different behaviors. In D&D versus the *Wrath of Ashardalon* boardgame, players investigate differently because "the game structure is different." Similarly, urban adventures require different structures than dungeoncrawls—treating wilderness like dungeons creates tedious gameplay.

---

## Hexcrawl

Justin Alexander outlines the foundational structure of hexcrawl gameplay in tabletop RPGs:

**Basic Hexcrawl Structure:**
1. Create a hexagonal map with numbered hexes showing terrain and points of interest
2. Develop encounter keys for each hex location
3. Establish mechanics for tracking overland movement
4. Trigger encounters when players enter new hexes

### Historical Context

Alexander notes that hexcrawls were initially central to RPGs but declined significantly. By 1989, few products featured functional hexcrawl designs, and 2nd Edition D&D eliminated hexcrawling mechanics entirely. The system experienced a revival when Necromancer Games republished the Wilderlands and Ben Robbins' "West Marches" campaign gained popularity.

### Design Philosophy

The author articulates four key goals for his hexcrawl system:

**Hidden hexes:** Players interact with the game world rather than the mechanical abstraction, making hexes a "player-unknown structure."

**Exploration focus:** The system emphasizes navigation, becoming lost, and rediscovery through robust mechanics.

**Reusable content:** Rather than ephemeral encounters, keys focus on geographic features that support repeated visits.

**Uncertainty mechanisms:** Encounter checks add unpredictability about whether keyed content triggers, supporting dynamic generation systems.

---

## 5E Hexcrawl

Justin Alexander presents a comprehensive guide for running hexcrawls in D&D 5th Edition. A hexcrawl is a game structure enabling wilderness exploration through numbered hex maps with keyed content and travel mechanics.

### Historical Context

Hexcrawls were core to early D&D but faded by the 1980s. They resurfaced through products like the Wilderlands and Ben Robbins' West Marches campaign, gaining renewed popularity through adventures like Kingmaker and Tomb of Annihilation.

### Core Hexcrawl Components

Alexander identifies four essential features: hexmaps showing terrain and locations; keyed content referenced to hex numbers; travel mechanics determining PC movement; and triggered encounters when entering hexes.

### The Alexandrian Approach

Alexander's system emphasizes four design goals: hiding hexes from players (maintaining world immersion rather than abstract mechanics); building exploration through navigation and discovery; keying locations rather than ephemeral encounters; and ensuring every hex contains meaningful content to maintain pacing and provide navigation landmarks.

### 5E Challenges

Fifth Edition presents complications: rules scatter across multiple books with inconsistent variations between products; mechanical elements essential to hexcrawl play are trivialized; and many wilderness rules remain outside the SRD, limiting accessibility.

---

## Running the Hexcrawl

When running a hexcrawl campaign, Justin Alexander maintains four key organizational tools:

**The Hex Map** is printed on a single 8.5" x 11" sheet placed flat on the table for easy reference during play.

**The Binder** serves as the campaign's central reference, containing background information about historical periods, civilizations, terrain types, environmental conditions, random encounter tables, and the hex key itself.

**The Folder** holds individual location documents. Any location requiring more than one page gets its own file, sorted by hex number for quick access during sessions.

**Campaign Status Sheet** is reprinted before each session and tracks active events in home base cities, empty complexes that might be reinhabited, current rumors, player-run businesses, and hireling morale information.

### Status Quo Prep

The hexcrawl's strength lies in its front-loaded preparation. Once the hex key and location documents are complete, session prep becomes minimal—typically just 10-15 minutes spent updating notes.

This efficiency works because locations exist in "status quo" until the party interacts with them. Without continued PC involvement, situations trend back toward equilibrium.

---

## Pointcrawls

A pointcrawl is a scenario structure featuring locations (points) connected by paths (connectors), creating a node-based map. Players navigate by selecting paths from their current location to reach new areas.

### Key Concepts

**Origins and Versatility**
The concept was formalized by Chris Kutalik in 2014, though earlier examples exist. What makes pointcrawls effective is that each "point" can represent any scale—from "a strange red rock" to "an entire kingdom." Multiple scales coexist naturally within the same structure, and pointcrawls can function fractally.

**Literal vs. Abstract Paths**
Pointcrawls operate within an underlying reality (strata). Literal paths represent physical trails or roads with one-to-one correspondence to the game world. Abstract paths capture conceptual navigation, such as moving through a city's landmarks and thoroughfares rather than every street.

**Navigation Examples**
In urban settings, players think of navigation in broad terms: "head west to the avenue, then south." The pointcrawl aligns with this mental model, with connections representing general flow rather than precise routes.

### Basic Procedures

1. **Follow a path** - Choose a connected route; travel duration varies by connection
2. **Check for encounters** - Use random encounter procedures, potentially one per time interval
3. **Arrival** - Reach the destination point; funnel off-map exploration back onto the map

---

## Thinking About Urbancrawls

Justin Alexander explores the challenge of developing an "urbancrawl" structure—a scenario framework for city-based adventures that mirrors the success of dungeoncrawls and hexcrawls.

### Key Concepts

Alexander defines a 'crawl structure by four characteristics:

1. **Mapped keyed locations** providing straightforward preparation
2. **Geographic movement** between locations as default navigation
3. **Exploration-based goals** motivating player engagement
4. **Engagement flexibility** allowing players to disengage and return

The author notes that "characters can engage, disengage, and re-engage with the scenario" because material is firewalled, goals are holographic (partial completion feels satisfying), and objectives remain non-interdependent.

### The Central Problem

Alexander distinguishes between running urban adventures and creating an urbancrawl structure. He successfully runs city campaigns using node-based design, but these structures fail in open-table settings where different player groups attend each session. Node-based designs depend on cause-and-effect chains that collapse with rotating participation.

---

## Game Structure: Sector Crawl

The sector crawl addresses a specific design challenge: how to structure exploration of large areas with sparse points of interest. Unlike traditional dungeon crawls (which work best with high-density encounters), sector crawls divide territory into large zones, each typically containing one primary element of interest.

### Key Components

**Sectors**
Sectors function as large chunks of the exploration area. The author recommends designing around points of interest first, then determining which sector contains each element. "Generally have one point of interest per sector" while ensuring sectors align with how characters naturally understand the environment.

**Connections**
Sector crawls feature "open access" mechanics—characters can typically navigate between sectors without being forced through every intermediate space. Some connections can be mysterious (discovered only through exploration) or act as chokepoints limiting movement.

**Encounters**
Encounters function similarly to other crawl structures, potentially triggered randomly or programmed into specific sectors.

### Running the System

Gameplay alternates between moving to new sectors or exploring current ones. Exploration reveals the sector's identity, its point of interest, and any hidden connections. The system remains straightforward: "Running a sector crawl largely consists of going to a new sector or exploring the current sector."

---

## Game Structure: Party Planning

Justin Alexander provides a comprehensive framework for running memorable social events in RPG campaigns.

### Key Components

**Location**: The venue should offer multiple distinct areas where groups can form and separate naturally. Alexander advises against overly small or simple spaces, suggesting that venues like nightclubs with dance floors, bars, and VIP sections work effectively. Private areas add intrigue when NPCs slip in and out of them.

**Guest List**: Prepare 10-20 NPCs using the Universal NPC Roleplaying Template. He recommends printing individual sheets for each character and suggests visual handouts help players remember who they're speaking with.

**Main Event Sequence**: Develop a linear progression of major occurrences—announcements, arrivals, debates—that provide structure without dictating player choices. These serve as "rock candy string," creating a framework around which memorable moments crystallize.

**Topics of Conversation**: Compile 5-8 discussion points ranging from momentous events to trivial matters. This helps NPCs feel reactive and grounded when players engage them.

### Running the Event

Encourage party splitting and rotating between conversations. Keep social groups moving, reintroducing NPCs and topics with different characters. Allow players agency in choosing which interactions to pursue rather than forcing engagement.

The quick version requires just 5 minutes of prep: 3-5 locations, 10 characters, 5 events, and 5 conversation topics.

---

## Deus Ex: Tactical Hacking

Justin Alexander presents a game system for tabletop RPGs designed to replicate the hacking mechanics found in *Deus Ex: Human Revolution*. The system addresses a practical challenge: replicating the depth and immersion of discovering numerous pieces of information through computer terminals without requiring excessive preparation.

### Core Concept

The system assumes hackers are "opportunistically targeting systems to compromise" with the primary goal of gathering information. It uses a D20-style skill check framework adaptable to various RPG systems.

### Key Components

**Networks**: Collections of meaningfully related systems organized around a Network Intel Table (NIT), where each entry represents discrete information with an associated difficulty class.

**Terminals**: Any hackable device (computers, phones, accounts) rated by three properties:
- *Access Cap*: Maximum effective DC achievable on that system
- *Intel Value*: Maximum number of information pieces obtainable
- *Security Modifier*: Penalty/bonus applied to hacking checks

**Special Features**: Terminals may include communications control, data tunnels linking systems, high-value content bonuses, specific intel, or systems control capabilities.

# At the Table

## The Art of Rulings

Justin Alexander explains his approach to making rulings as a Game Master, advocating for systems with mechanical support rather than pure GM fiat. He argues that good rules "enable new forms of play and expand the scope."

### Three Key Principles

**1. Passive Observation is Automatically Triggered**

Characters automatically notice obvious things (like a flaming sphere in a room) and reactive mechanics determine if they perceive hidden details without player prompting.

**2. Player Expertise Activates Character Expertise**

Players must actively declare actions to activate skill checks. Alexander rejects the notion that character expertise should override player choice, arguing this would undermine roleplaying itself. However, he acknowledges that "pixel-bitching"—demanding excessive mechanical detail—can become tedious.

**3. Player Expertise Can Trump Character Expertise**

Specific, creative actions can bypass mechanics. A player smashing a chest with an axe finds hidden compartments automatically, while vague declarations lack this benefit. Alexander emphasizes finding "the meaningful choice" as the sweet spot.

**Key insight:** "Never assume that a character is doing anything which requires a meaningful choice unless the player makes that choice."

---

## The Art of Pacing

Justin Alexander's essay examines pacing in tabletop roleplaying games, arguing that borrowing film and theater techniques produces suboptimal results because RPGs operate on fundamentally different principles.

### Core Concepts

**The Fundamental Principle of RPGs**

Alexander defines roleplaying as "a conversation" where players make meaningful choices as characters. The basic loop consists of:

1. GM presents a situation
2. Player chooses an action
3. GM adjudicates the outcome and presents a new situation

**Empty Time**

The key to effective pacing is identifying and eliminating "empty time: The gap between one set of meaningful decisions and the next meaningful choice." Rather than playing out every mundane action (like turn-by-turn directions through a city), GMs should skip to moments requiring player decision-making.

**The Spectrum of Scene-Framing**

Different approaches exist on a continuum:

- **Hard framing**: GM makes significant narrative jumps, skipping many potential decisions (e.g., "It's two weeks later, and you're in Dink's store when...")
- **Soft framing**: GM skips some decisions but allows player input on others (e.g., asking tavern preference)
- **Light framing**: Minimal skipping, nearly turn-by-turn play

**Finding the Balance**

The threshold for "meaningful choices" varies based on game type, setting, players, and context. Dungeon-crawls naturally eliminate pacing concerns through high-density decision-making.

---

## The Art of the Key

This essay examines how dungeon keys—the descriptions accompanying numbered locations on adventure maps—have evolved in tabletop RPG publishing, and why most published keys are poorly designed for actual gameplay.

### A Brief History of the Key

The earliest D&D materials featured instructional rather than practical key descriptions. By 1976, published adventures introduced various formatting approaches:

- **Palace of the Vampire Queen** used a tabular format
- **Lost Caverns of Tsojconth** employed Gygax's characteristic "wall of text" approach
- **Gen Con IX Dungeons** innovated with a "DM Only" section separating player-facing and GM-only information

### The Boxed Text Era

In 1979-1980, **The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan** introduced boxed text—prewritten descriptions meant to be read aloud to players. This clearly delineated what information players received upon entering a location.

### The Core Problem

Rigid formatting becomes counterproductive. Information presented out of logical sequence confuses rather than aids GMs during play. A room containing a hidden goblin shouldn't lead with the goblin's description; one with a prominent ogre should mention it first. One-size-fits-all structures ultimately obstruct effective reference during actual sessions.

---

## The Railroading Manifesto

Justin Alexander defines railroading as a specific moment when "the GM negates a player's choice in order to enforce a preconceived outcome." Critically, both elements matter: players must attempt to leave the predetermined path, and the GM must block them to maintain their intended storyline.

### What Isn't Railroading

Alexander clarifies several common misconceptions:

- **Failed rolls**: A player missing an attack or failing to break down a door isn't railroading—it's natural consequence
- **Predetermined events**: A GM knowing in advance that a villain will appear isn't railroading if it happens naturally
- **Consequences of choices**: When actions create ripple effects, that reinforces meaning rather than negating it

### Linear vs. Railroaded Design

Not all linear scenarios are problematic. The article presents a mystery example with multiple investigation paths leading to the same culprits—the sequence is predetermined, but the methods vary. This prevents railroad necessity because players have genuine alternatives.

### Common Rationalizations Examined

The author critiques several justifications GMs offer:

- **"Only when it's really important"**: Often means protecting a predetermined outcome
- **Controlling problem players**: Symptoms of broken table dynamics requiring external solutions
- **Creating specific situations for dramatic effect**: Ironically undermines decision-making authenticity

## GM Don't List #1: Morphing Reality

Justin Alexander's first entry in his "GM Don't List" series addresses a fundamental gamemastering mistake: allowing the game world's reality to shift inconsistently during play.

### The Core Problem

The article explains that nothing damages player engagement faster than watching the game world's rules or geography change without explanation. Alexander illustrates this with examples like a compartment that alternates between vacuum and normal atmosphere, or doors that mysteriously appear and disappear.

### Why Consistency Matters

Alexander argues that maintaining world integrity is "the GM's most fundamental task" because it enables meaningful player choices—the defining characteristic of roleplaying games. When reality morphs, players cannot make informed decisions about their actions.

Common manifestations include:

- Geographic inconsistencies (changing distances, vanishing hallways)
- NPC appearance changes
- Mechanical inconsistency with rules application

### Solutions Offered

**Improving Your Mental Model:**
Know your cognitive limits regarding simultaneous tracking. Create maps, take NPC notes, maintain campaign journals.

**Better Communication:**
Use precise language, visual aids, and photographic references to establish clear shared understanding with players.

**Table Triage:**
- Notice when player actions suggest confusion
- Benefit-of-doubt their interpretations
- Offer compromises aligned with your vision
- Allow minor retcons when necessary

## Universal NPC Roleplaying Template

Justin Alexander presents a structured approach to organizing NPC descriptions for tabletop RPGs. Rather than lengthy narrative paragraphs, this template breaks character information into distinct, functional categories designed for quick reference during gameplay.

### Core Template Structure

The template consists of six main sections:

**Name** - Character's identifier

**Appearance** - A brief 1-2 sentence boxed description for first encounters. Alexander emphasizes selecting distinctive features rather than comprehensive details.

**Quote** - A single representative sentence capturing the character's unique voice (optional).

**Roleplaying** - "The heart of the template" featuring 2-3 bullet points including: a distinctive physical mannerism the GM can perform while playing, personality traits, and behavioral patterns. Alexander notes: *"This mannerism is your hook"* allowing easy character reinduction after long intervals.

**Background** - Narrative context covering essential information the PCs might discover or that influences NPC decisions. Focuses on relevant anecdotes rather than irrelevant life details.

**Key Info** - Bulleted essential interaction points, mysteries clues, employment terms, or information the NPCs convey.

**Stat Block** - System-specific mechanics (optional).

### Design Philosophy

The system requires no additional prep time compared to traditional methods while improving accessibility during play.

## Advanced NPC Roleplaying Templates

Alexander presents refinements to his Universal NPC Roleplaying Template, originally created in 2015.

### Key Sections

**Briefing Sheets**
The author recommends keeping each NPC on a single page for quick reference during gameplay. Including a picture at the top helps locate characters rapidly.

**Quote Removal**
The original template included character quotes, but Alexander discontinued this practice. He found quotes provided limited value.

**Roleplaying: Avoiding Repetition**
Three distinct bullet points work best. The author cautions against restating the same concept in different ways.

**Background Bold**
Bolding key concepts in background sections enhances readability during play.

**Expanded Key Info**
Multiple Key Info sections can organize lengthy content by function or topic—for example: "Key Info – Clues" and "Key Info – Topics of Conversation" for party scenarios.

### Experimental Sections

**Key Info – Reactions**
Lists NPC responses to specific PC prompts, functioning as "unlocked" information triggered by particular questions.

**Key Info – Actions**
Documents proactive social gambits NPCs pursue, shifting from reactive presentation to dynamic engagement.

**Key Info – Resources**
Catalogs available resources the NPC possesses or can offer.

**Social Profile**
A new experimental section summarizing effective and ineffective social tactics for interacting with the NPC.

## Running the City

Justin Alexander's guide on urban campaign design emphasizes that cities can function as settings for countless campaign types—from heists to conspiracies to procedurals.

### Core Preparation Elements

The article recommends prepping five main components:

1. **Map**: Obtain street maps for real cities or create custom ones, breaking down geography into districts connected by major routes.

2. **Districts (6-12 per city)**: Divide the city into neighborhoods with distinct character. Include general descriptions covering businesses, architecture, demographics, and history.

3. **Landmarks**: List three or more "things in the district" per area—taverns, statues, buildings—that become reference points for players' mental maps.

4. **Scenic Encounters**: Create district-specific random encounters that make different areas feel distinct.

5. **Services**: Prepare meaningful options (inns, taverns, shops, healing) rather than exhaustive lists.

### Key Design Principle

Urban environments succeed through persistence. As Alexander notes, players build "the city up in the players' imagination over time by showing them the same locations and geography again and again."

---

## Running Combat

Key recommendations for managing combat sessions:

### 1. Rolling Initiative Last
Collect initiative rolls at the end of the previous combat encounter rather than at the start of the next one. This eliminates delays when combat begins.

### 2. Initiative Cards
Writing each participant's name on index cards and noting their initiative results allows GMs to physically flip through the turn order.

### 3. Initial Battle Presentation
Rather than spending time setting up the battlemap before beginning, weave the setup into the narrative itself.

### 4. Glass Beads as Counters
Inexpensive glass beads provide affordable alternatives to miniatures.

### 5. Combat Cheat Sheets
Maintain three essential references: player character armor classes, monster statistics formatted clearly, and a summary of combat mechanics.

### 6. Transparency About Target Numbers
Once the encounter begins, revealing the target difficulty number accelerates play without sacrificing drama.

### 7. Multitasking During Combat
While one player makes their attack roll, ask the next participant their action.

### 8. Rolling Multiple Dice at Once
When multiple similar enemies attack, roll all their dice simultaneously.

### 9. Descriptive Combat Narration
Despite pursuing speed, maintain vivid descriptions of combat actions.

### 10. Interesting Encounter Design
Vary encounters every third or fourth combat with unique elements: unusual terrain, environmental hazards, or tactical complications.

### 11. Combat as Character Development
Use combat to reveal character development and advance the plot rather than treating fights as mere violence interludes.

### 12. Training Scenarios
Design encounters specifically to practice unfamiliar combat rules through repetition.

---

## Visualizing Combat

This piece by Justin Alexander offers guidance on helping game masters visualize and describe combat encounters effectively.

### Battle Maps and Grid Rigidity

Alexander explains that while battle maps provide useful reference points, they can create "grid rigidity"—static descriptions where characters seem frozen in place. He suggests that miniature positions represent approximations rather than exact locations, allowing for more dynamic descriptions.

### Theatre of the Mind Combat

For games without battle maps, the author recommends conceptualizing combat through **melees** and **battle lines**:

- *Melees* abstract groups of combatants fighting together, simplifying tracking without sacrificing vivid descriptions
- *Battle lines* work for formation-based combat, particularly in dungeon corridors

### Building Skills Through Practice

The author suggests that narrating fight scenes from films like *John Wick* or *300* helps develop vocabulary and understanding of combat pacing.

---

## Revisiting Encounter Design

Justin Alexander's essay examines how D&D 3rd Edition's encounter design guidelines were misinterpreted by the gaming community.

### The Misreading

Alexander notes that while the 3rd Edition DMG explicitly recommended varied encounter difficulties—with only 50% at the party's level and 30% below—the community adopted a narrower interpretation: "every encounter should have an EL equal to the party's level."

### Consequences of This Approach

- Combat duration increased significantly
- Players adopted cautious playstyles, making the "15-minute adventuring day" common
- Mega-dungeons became difficult to run effectively
- Monster utility decreased due to narrower applicable level ranges

### Alexander's Recommendations

1. Design most encounters 2-4 levels below party level
2. Use large mob encounters (10+ creatures) strategically
3. Reserve EL-equal encounters for major set pieces
4. Employ EL+2 or EL+4 encounters sparingly for dramatic impact

### The Philosophy

This approach creates a "wider dynamic range," allowing players to experience meaningful progression. Lower-difficulty encounters resolve quickly, enabling more combats per session and faster pacing.

---

## Session 0 Modules

Justin Alexander's piece examines the essential preparation required before beginning a tabletop RPG campaign.

### Core Elements

**Group Contract**: "A group contract is the group's formal and informal agreements about how the game will be run and played." This encompasses gameplay rules, narrative expectations, safety mechanisms, and practical logistics.

**Campaign Concept**: This defines who the player characters are and their objectives—whether they're retired spies hunting vampires or investigators solving crimes.

**Setting**: The location and world context must align with the campaign concept.

**Character Creation**: Players develop both mechanical attributes and backstories, integrating their characters into the established setting and campaign.

### Session 0 Modules Concept

Rather than prescribing a single approach, Alexander proposes flexible "modules"—standalone techniques that game masters can selectively incorporate.

---

# Running Mysteries

## Running Mysteries: The Null Result

The foundation of mystery narratives rests on knowledge acquisition rather than ignorance. Paradoxically, allowing investigators to search thoroughly without finding evidence proves essential for engaging mysteries. This represents a "null result"—crucial feedback that shapes problem-solving.

### Hypothesis Testing Through Investigation

The author frames mystery-solving like the scientific method. Player-characters form theories and test them against the game world. "If it's a werewolf, then attacks would occur only during full moons" or "Muddy footprints would indicate window entry." When searches yield nothing, investigators eliminate false conclusions and refine their approach.

### Problematic Workarounds

Common advice warns against allowing clue-discovery failures, yet some popular techniques undermine investigation depth:

- Retroactively adjusting solutions to match player theories
- Improvising clues regardless of investigation methods
- Auto-discovering all clues automatically

These approaches remove investigative texture by eliminating genuine hypothesis feedback.

### Balanced Solutions

The author acknowledges these techniques address real problems but advocates for robust mystery frameworks preserving investigative integrity. The *Three Clue Rule* enables multiple pathways to essential information, preventing single-missed-clue catastrophes while maintaining meaningful null results.

---

## Running Mysteries: Returning to the Scene of the Crime

Justin Alexander explores a classic mystery narrative technique where player characters revisit locations they've previously investigated, discovering new clues or revelations they initially missed.

### The Core Dynamic

The article describes how "a noir detective, stymied in his investigation, returns to the scene of the crime" seeking overlooked details.

### Organic Emergence

When using node-based scenario design with the Three Clue Rule, revisits happen naturally. Players may stake out a location, find nothing immediately useful, pursue other leads, then later discover they need to return for "clandestine excavation" of previously missed information.

### Intentional Variation

Designers can deliberately structure scenarios where PCs visit locations for non-investigative reasons initially, then return later with investigation as their focus. More complex designs layer multiple sets of clues—early clues point toward one node aspect, while later clues reveal "a completely different aspect."

### Failing Scenarios & Recovery

When players become genuinely stuck without revisiting nodes, offering "a new clue pointing them back" works better than simply directing them to previous locations.

---

## Running Mysteries: Hints

The article distinguishes between clues and hints in mystery scenarios. While clues point to specific conclusions, hints are more general and suggestive—they raise questions rather than provide answers.

### Definition and Examples

A hint can be obvious or subtle. Obvious examples include "a bloody handprint smeared across the wall" or "a portrait with the eyes gouged out." Subtle hints might involve "broken pieces of glass on a dungeon floor" or repeated metaphorical references that only gain significance later.

The author emphasizes that hints are intentional—not random decoration—but their meaning remains "fractured, partial, distorted, or incomplete."

### Uses for Hints

Hints serve multiple purposes:

- **Mood and tone setting** signal that something unusual or terrible has occurred
- **Danger warnings** prompt players to take defensive action
- **Investigation signals** direct attention to specific locations or objects
- **Foreshadowing** prepares players for future revelations

---

## Running Mysteries: Background Revelations

Not every possible revelation in a mystery scenario is load-bearing.

### Key Distinction

Understanding the difference between structural revelations (which are essential to finishing the scenario) and background revelations (which enhance but aren't strictly necessary) offers practical advantages when designing and running mystery scenarios.

### Design Recommendations

1. **Keep Separate Lists:** Maintain background revelations on a completely separate revelation list from structural revelations.

2. **Apply Three Clue Rule:** Since you do want players to learn background information, use the Three Clue Rule to position clues for maximum effect.

3. **Don't Track During Play:** Since background revelations are structurally nonessential, you don't need to track them during play.

4. **Declutter Your Main List:** Removing nonessential revelations from your main list makes tracking structural revelations easier during play.

### Purpose of Background Revelations

While not required for success, background revelations provide essential meaning to scenarios:

- **Deliver Memorable Moments:** They create those "oh wow, that's cool!" moments
- **Show Through Investigation:** Background revelations demonstrate worldbuilding through player discovery
- **Provide Scenario Texture:** Small victories like discovering a cult's religious affiliation keep players motivated
- **Support Player Agency:** They give players more to investigate and more opportunities to feel accomplished

---

## Making Clues

Justin Alexander's article addresses a fundamental question for game masters designing mystery scenarios: how to generate sufficient clues for players to solve the mystery.

### Six Types of Clues

**Static clues** are specific information accessible through one particular method.

**Flexible clues** provide the same information through multiple paths—for example, valuable data could be obtained by hacking a database, raiding a location, or bribing an employee.

**Proactive clues** actively approach the players, as exemplified by Raymond Chandler's famous phrase: "A guy with a gun walks through the door."

**Reactive clues** depend on players spontaneously choosing investigative methods like research or divination.

**Dynamic clues** emerge when players take logical investigative actions the GM hadn't specifically prepared for.

**Unassigned clues** represent pure improvisation where GMs only prep revelations and create clues on-the-fly.

### Strategic Design Advice

Rather than asking "What clues exist here?", GMs should reframe it as "What specifically must players learn from this location?" Alexander suggests consulting a game system's skill list for inspiration.

---

## Using Revelation Lists

Justin Alexander explains a practical organizational technique for game masters designing node-based scenarios.

### What is a Revelation List?

A revelation list catalogs all clues that lead toward a particular conclusion or location. As Alexander states, this contrasts with clue lists: "You can list all the clues a node contains or you can list all the clues that point to the node."

### Two Organizational Approaches

During initial design, GMs create clue lists (what information exists at each location). These transform into revelation lists for actual play—essentially reversing the perspective to show what guides players toward destinations.

### Practical Benefits

The revelation list serves dual purposes: it functions as a progress tracker during sessions and provides diagnostic data. If players lack sufficient clues to locate a node, the GM can proactively introduce additional information.

---

## Mythos Revelations

The article outlines a three-layer technique for creating Lovecraftian horror in RPGs that balances comprehensibility with mystery. The author argues that "perfect understanding of the Mythos renders that which should be too vast for human comprehension into mundanity," yet complete incomprehensibility frustrates gameplay.

### Layer 1: Canonical Truth

Start by defining your Mythos element clearly for yourself. This serves as your personal reference point and helps maintain consistency, even though players never learn this definitive version.

### Layer 2: The Lens of Mythology

Break your canonical truth into chunks and mythologize each one through several techniques:

**Paradox** presents impossible dualities—"a darkness that illuminates; a vast, bulking mass of solidity that seems to float and ooze."

**Dialectic** approaches truth through confronting contradictions, combining scientific, religious, and cultist interpretations simultaneously.

**Ironic Specificity** reveals only fragments while hinting at unrevealed wholes.

**Multiple Titles/Names** defy easy categorization.

**Parable and Analogy** help humans grasp the incomprehensible.

**Confusion/Shaded Truth** acknowledges that accumulated translations and misunderstandings naturally corrupt original statements.

### Layer 3: Player Experience

Players encounter only clues rather than organized information. The author recommends "poetic" clues that encourage players to apprehend rather than comprehend truth.

---

## Speak With Dead Mysteries

Justin Alexander challenges the common GM belief that the *speak with dead* spell ruins murder mysteries. He argues this misconception stems from misunderstanding what mysteries actually are.

"A mystery is seemingly defined by a lack of knowledge, but the actual action of a mystery is not the withholding of knowledge but rather the discovery of knowledge."

Rather than blocking investigation, the spell simply represents one investigative method—comparable to an FBI team collecting fingerprints or CSI analyzing video evidence.

### The Witness Analogy

Alexander uses a straightforward comparison: if PCs interview a witness who identifies the killer, you wouldn't conclude mysteries are impossible. The spell functions identically—as testimony from another witness.

### Design Solutions

Instead of nerfing the spell, GMs should design mysteries around its existence. Since NPCs in-world know magic exists, criminals will adapt. A murderer might use *polymorph* to disguise themselves, ensuring the victim gives misleading information when questioned later.

---

## Zone of Truth Mysteries

Justin Alexander addresses how to run mystery scenarios when player characters have access to the *zone of truth* spell.

### The Core Principle

Alexander emphasizes that mysteries shouldn't withhold information but rather challenge players to *acquire* it. The spell becomes problematic only if it trivializes other investigation methods.

### Investigation Structure

Rather than isolating suspects for interrogation, effective mysteries focus on players discovering *what questions to ask first*.

### Practical Obstacles

GMs can introduce natural barriers: suspects refusing to enter the zone, time limitations expiring mid-interrogation, difficulty locating suspects, or cultural prohibitions against enchantment magic.

### NPC Evasion Tactics

Even truthful NPCs can frustrate interrogation through incomplete answers, answering questions with questions, running out the clock, or refusing to answer entirely.

---

# Open Game Tables

## Opening Your Game Table

Justin Alexander presents a compelling argument for restructuring RPG campaigns to accommodate modern adult schedules through "open table" gaming.

### Core Argument

Alexander contrasts childhood gaming—playing "whenever possible"—with modern campaigns requiring rigid scheduling and long-term commitments (typically 80+ hours over months). He identifies this inflexibility as a barrier to both participation and introducing newcomers.

The solution he advocates: adopting a megadungeon structure that enables variable player groups.

### Key Concept: The Megadungeon Model

Rather than a traditional campaign where specific characters explore a continuous storyline, megadungeons feature:

- An enormous dungeon too vast to fully explore in dozens of sessions
- A nearby settlement where adventurers form temporary parties
- Sessions ending with parties returning to town
- Next session: different players, different characters, same dungeon

### The Baseball Analogy

Alexander uses an effective metaphor: recruiting someone for a rigid sports league requires extensive commitment, but simply asking someone to "play catch" is accessible.

### Results

After implementing this structure, Alexander reports dramatic increases in gaming frequency—expanding from 2 monthly sessions to multiple weekly opportunities with 30+ potential players.

---

## Open Table Manifesto

Alexander contrasts two approaches to running tabletop RPGs: the traditional dedicated campaign and the open table model.

### The Dedicated Table Model

The conventional approach requires players to commit 80+ hours over months or years, attending regular sessions with a stable group. While this creates deep narrative experiences, it creates barriers.

### The Open Table Alternative

Alexander uses a baseball analogy: most people learn baseball by "playing catch," not by joining a competitive league. Similarly, open table campaigns allow flexible participation.

**Key advantages:**

- "Feel like playing on Thursday? Send out an e-mail saying, 'We're playing on Thursday...'"
- Eliminates scheduling logistics
- Welcomes new players without long-term commitment expectations
- Rapidly expands player pools (Alexander grew from 8-9 players to 60+)

### Historical Context

Early D&D campaigns, particularly megadungeons, inherently supported open table play. This structure allowed 50+ participants, creating viral growth for the hobby.

---

## Keep on the Borderlands: Factions in the Dungeon

Justin Alexander's article explores how introducing competing factions into dungeon environments creates dynamic, self-sustaining gameplay.

### Core Concept

The fundamental principle is straightforward: "If your dungeon has a life beyond the activities of the PCs, it is much easier to revitalize the dungeon between delves."

### Random Faction Interaction System

Alexander provides practical mechanics using the Caves of Chaos from B2 Keep on the Borderlands:

**Faction Conflict Check**: After each PC visit, roll 1d6. On a 6, conflict erupts. Roll twice to determine combatants, then consult the Conflict Resolution Table (1d8) for outcomes:

- Stalemate Skirmish (minimal changes)
- One Faction Damaged (~25% losses)
- One Faction Crippled (~50% losses)
- One Faction Destroyed
- Both Factions Damaged
- Both Factions Crippled
- Both Factions Destroyed
- Factions Unite

### Scalability

Beyond dungeons, the framework adapts to urban campaigns with competing gangs, merchant princes, or criminal families.

---

## Escaping the Dungeon

Alexander designed a rule system for campaigns accommodating variable player attendance. The fundamental principle ensures player characters exit dungeons at session's end.

### Three Session-Ending Options

Players may depart the dungeon whenever desired. Alternatively, the GM can announce a one-hour countdown to session end. If characters remain underground after this period, players face the "Escaping the Dungeon!" resolution tables.

### Escape Check Mechanics

Success chances depend on situational awareness:
- "You don't know where you are: 25%"
- "You know where you are: 50%"
- "You have a clear and unhindered path of escape: 75%"

### Failed Escape Consequences

A d10 roll determines outcomes ranging from unharmed escape to death, permanent injury, equipment loss, capture, transformation, or betrayal opportunities.

---

## Breathing Life Into the Wandering Monster

Alexander advocates for open table gaming as a sustainable way to grow the RPG hobby. He contends that procedural content generation enables GMs to minimize prep work while keeping campaigns fresh.

### The Critical Insight: Contextualization

When rolling a wandering monster, ask four questions:

1. What makes them unique?
2. Where are they coming from?
3. What are they doing?
4. What's their reaction to the PCs?

These questions transform generic encounters into meaningful moments. A simple "3d6 orcs attack" becomes interesting when you establish context—perhaps they're religious zealots preaching conversion, or mercenaries seeking employment.

---

# Beginning GM Tips

## Prep Tips for the Beginning DM

For novice game masters, Alexander recommends a location-based preparation approach as the foundation for adventure design. The methodology involves three straightforward steps: "Draw a map. Number the rooms. Key the rooms (i.e., describe what's in each room)."

### Progressive Skill Development

**Stage One:** Start with a Five Room Dungeon structure to build foundational skills.

**Stage Two:** Expand to larger dungeons while implementing dynamic encounter design. This involves creating an independent Adversary Roster so monsters actively pursue objectives rather than passively waiting in rooms.

**Stage Three:** After running approximately a dozen adventures, introduce non-location-based preparation methods. Alexander recommends exploring concepts like the Three Clue Rule, Node-Based Scenario Design, and Hexcrawls.

### Avoiding Over-Preparation

Alexander stresses efficiency: "If you're spending more time prepping it than your players spend playing it, you're probably doing something wrong."

The author emphasizes that "Details are overrated" except for essential or particularly awesome elements.

---

## Failure for the Beginning GM

The article argues that failure in roleplaying games serves an essential function: it "provokes creativity, heightens the stakes, and drives the adventure in interesting directions."

The solution involves shifting from plot-based preparation to situation-based preparation. With situation-based prep, "the pre-planned route doesn't exist" and therefore players bear responsibility for finding alternatives when they fail.

### Three Introductory Techniques

**Technique 1: No Retries**

The simplest approach prevents repeated attempts at the same task. A failed lockpick check means the lock cannot be opened that way.

**Technique 2: Failing Forward**

This intermediate method treats failures as "success-with-complications." When it feels unnatural to prevent retries, introduce costs instead:

- Extra payment required
- Character takes damage
- Equipment breaks
- Additional time consumed
- Unwanted discovery by others

**Technique 3: Basic Progress Clock**

This visual tracking system involves drawing a circle divided into sections. When players fail relevant checks, one section fills. When the clock completes, a predetermined consequence triggers.

---

## Roleplaying for the Beginning GM

Justin Alexander's guide addresses the challenges new Game Masters face when managing multiple NPCs, rules, pacing, and descriptions simultaneously.

### Key Tips

**Tip 1: Pick Your Role**
Frame roleplaying scenes around a single NPC when possible. If multiple NPCs are present, designate one as the spokesperson.

**Tip 2: Touchstone**
Develop a distinct physical mannerism for each NPC rather than relying solely on accents. Examples include neck rubbing, imperious sniffing, coin flipping, or specific postures.

**Tip 3: Objective**
Every NPC needs a clear, single-sentence goal expressed in first-person perspective. Examples: "I want them to rescue my daughter" or "I need them to understand the danger."

**Tip 4: Resolution Point**
Recognize three possible scene outcomes: goals are accomplished (conclude the scene), action transforms the scene (combat or chase ensues), or uncertainty remains (call for a social skill check).

---

## Your First Homebrew Setting

Justin Alexander presents a practical approach to creating a campaign setting without extensive preparation. The core thesis: you need only 3-6 pages to begin gaming in your own world.

### The Minimal Prep Packet consists of three sections:

1. **Broad World Detail (1-2 pages):** High-level overview providing context for your campaign's starting location.

2. **Character Creation Requirements (1-2 pages):** Information players need to create characters—deities for clerics, available languages, cultural details.

3. **Local Setting (1-2 pages):** An aggressive focus on where the campaign begins. This covers navigation methods, local authorities, factions, and essential resources.

### Strategic Advantages

The prep packet doubles as player briefing material—approximately five pages, which represents the maximum reasonable reading load before session one.

Alexander emphasizes: "You need less than you think."

---

# Random GM Tips

## Getting the Players to Care

This comprehensive guide addresses a common GM frustration: players forgetting or not caring about carefully crafted lore.

### Core Strategies

**Stop Playing Poker**
GMs must actively share information rather than hiding details behind screens. "Details which the PCs can never learn of or interact with aren't worth wasting time on."

**Make It Short**
Information overload causes players to tune out. Breaking complex lore into digestible pieces proves more effective than extended monologues.

**Make It Plot**
Players remember things they actively experience over things they're told.

**Make It Treasure**
"Players pay attention when you describe treasure." Embedding lore within valuable items captures attention naturally.

**Make It Mystery**
Breaking information into separate revelations encourages players to piece together solutions themselves.

**Make It Personal**
Connecting lore to PC backgrounds during character creation ensures player investment.

**Make It Physical**
Handouts provide tangible, persistent reminders.

**Make It Repetitive**
Strategic repetition across varied contexts reinforces important information without becoming tedious.

---

## Prepping System Cheat Sheets

Justin Alexander shares his methodology for creating comprehensive RPG system cheat sheets.

### Key Principles

**Comprehensive Bullet Points**
Alexander prioritizes including all rules, not just frequently-used mechanics.

**Exclude Character-Specific Options**
Rather than including feats, spells, disadvantages, and weapons on system sheets, apply the "power card principle"—these belong on individual character sheets.

**Strip Clarifications and Advice**
Cheat sheets should eliminate extra material from rulebooks.

**Reorganize for Gameplay**
RPG manuals often scatter related rules across multiple chapters. Alexander recommends reorganizing material logically for actual play.

**Iterative Refinement**
After running sessions, revisit and revise the cheat sheet based on what worked.

---

## Metagame Special Effects

The article explores using out-of-character mechanics to enhance players' emotional engagement with the game world.

### Example 1: The Screaming Voice

When handling a scenario where "a voice screaming comes from somewhere in the castle; it sounds exactly like one of the PCs":
- Randomly select a PC
- Have that player write two sentences on a note
- Announce the screaming sound while keeping the note exchange secret

This creates "uncertainty, fear, or paranoia" by establishing the possibility that something happened to the character.

### Example 2: Extraneous Spot Checks

Alexander regularly calls for perception checks when nothing is actually present. This obscures metagame knowledge about when something significant occurs and maintains player engagement.

---

## Running Horror

Justin Alexander's guide emphasizes that successful horror requires player investment in the game world. The core principle: "The players have to be invested in the game world. They have to CARE about something."

### Core Horror Elements

Effective horror combines four components:
- **Danger**: Characters perceive themselves outmatched by threats
- **Helplessness**: Characters see no escape from the imbalance
- **Anxiety**: Concern that danger or helplessness could occur
- **Enigma**: Uncertainty prompting players to imagine worst-case scenarios

### Effective Techniques

- Targeting what players genuinely care about (not just PC survival)
- Creating mysterious or distant dangers that limit player agency
- Establishing genuine consequences to demonstrate stakes are real
- Using phobias and priming to shape emotional responses

### Critical Warnings

Avoid telling players their characters feel afraid—this distances emotional engagement. Never railroad players into danger, as this redirects helplessness from the fiction toward the GM.

---

## The Grok Threshold (Running a Published Setting)

Justin Alexander addresses the anxiety many game masters feel about running campaigns in established settings with dense lore.

### The Problem

Many GMs believe they must master every detail of published settings before running them, which creates unnecessary pressure.

### The Solution

Alexander contends that "once you've hit that grok threshold, however, you should then feel free to own the setting (which can also mean making significant changes)."

### Practical Tips

1. **Time-boxed Research:** Give yourself 30 seconds to find details; if unsuccessful, improvise.
2. **Leverage Expertise:** Use knowledgeable players as resources.
3. **Start Small:** Begin in underdeveloped areas of settings where minimal canon exists.
4. **Limit Official Canon:** Restrict which "official" lore you consider binding.

---

## Adaptation & Reincorporation

Justin Alexander advocates for a balanced approach to using published RPG material in campaigns.

### Three Moments of Creative Elements

Alexander defines how creative elements develop through creation (initial conception), repetition (using it again similarly), and reincorporation (changing the element or revealing new connections).

### Adaptation Through Reincorporation

Rather than simply using new elements from published material, GMs should weave existing campaign elements into scenarios. This enriches both the immediate experience and long-term campaign depth.

**Key Takeaway:** "Reincorporation builds meaning; it builds relationships; it builds significance."

---

## Learning a New RPG

The article provides seven sequential steps for game masters preparing to run a new RPG system:

**Step #1: Read the Rulebook**
Complete cover-to-cover reading is essential.

**Step #2: Create Cheat Sheets**
Building a reference document deepens understanding.

**Step #3: Run a One-Shot**
Before launching a campaign, conduct a one-shot session using pre-generated characters.

**Step #4: Co-Opt Player Expertise**
Leverage player knowledge by asking them to look up rules.

**Step #5: Design Rules Highlight Sessions**
Create scenarios emphasizing particular subsystems.

**Step #6: Set Reference Time Limits**
Establish boundaries for rule lookups (30-60 seconds).

**Step #7: Create a Hierarchy of Reference**
Organize scenario notes so relevant mechanics appear on your reference pages.

---

## Backup PCs

This article explores practical strategies for handling player character death in tabletop RPGs.

### Three Main Methods for Managing Character Fatality

1. **Script Immunity**: Characters cannot die through game mechanics.
2. **One-PC-Only**: Removing the player entirely when their character dies.
3. **Replacement PCs**: The most common approach.

### The Backup PC Solution

The core recommendation involves preparing characters in advance. This solves two problems: reducing time needed for character creation and simplifying narrative integration.

### Extending the Concept

- **Common pools** of shared backup characters
- **Temporary roles** serving until full PCs are introduced
- **Multiple character swaps** without waiting for death
- Preventing Total Party Kills through established narrative structures

---

## What Were We Doing Again?

Justin Alexander addresses a common challenge: players forgetting crucial information between sessions.

### Key Recommendations

**Recap Procedures**: At the end of each session, ask players to summarize their current knowledge and planned next steps. Then, at the start of the next session, have them recap while you fill gaps.

**Encouraging Note-Taking**: Provide inexpensive pocket notebooks, optionally branded for the campaign.

**Physical Props Strategy**: Encode essential clues into tangible items—letters, business cards, photographs, maps, or lore books.

## Matryoshka Search Technique

Justin Alexander introduces a game mastering technique where players discover clues gradually rather than receiving direct answers. Instead of immediately revealing a hidden trap door when a character succeeds at a search check, the GM provides an intermediate clue—like scuff marks on the floor—that prompts further player investigation.

### Key Concept

The technique works as "nested dolls" of information. A successful skill check yields an indicator pointing toward the actual discovery, requiring players to interpret clues and decide on follow-up actions.

### Benefits

This approach increases player engagement by making them active problem-solvers rather than passive recipients of information.

## 2+2 Storytelling

Justin Alexander explores Andrew Stanton's storytelling principle: the "Unifying Theory of 2+2"—the idea that audiences become invested when they must mentally complete a story rather than receive everything explicitly.

### Making Audiences Work

Instead of presenting complete information, effective storytellers present incomplete equations. "Show them 2 + 2 and make them do the math" rather than simply showing four. This cognitive participation creates emotional investment.

### Application to RPGs

Unlike passive film audiences, RPG players actively investigate clues, giving them genuine ownership over discoveries.

## Surprising Scenario Hooks

Justin Alexander explores how game masters can create memorable scenarios by using misleading hooks that subvert player expectations.

### Misleading Hooks

Effective hooks can deceive players about either "the nature of the threat" or "the motives of various NPCs involved."

### Multiple Hooks Strategy

Using several distinct hooks from different sources—each containing different information—creates mystery and encourages engagement.

### The Bait Hook

This metagame device places players in a legitimate scenario solely to position them for the "true" scenario.

## Bringing the PCs Together

Justin Alexander addresses how to justify why disparate player characters work together.

### Four Main Approaches

**1. Character Creation Collaboration**
During character development, GMs should involve players in determining what binds their characters.

**2. Multiple Scenario Hooks**
Rather than forcing all PCs into one narrative path, design situations offering "multiple places to hang your hooks."

**3. Setting PCs in Opposition**
Antagonism creates compelling dynamics without requiring cooperation.

**4. Employing a Patron**
A hiring authority simplifies connection logistics.

## Rolling for Riddles

Justin Alexander argues that using dice rolls to solve riddles removes player agency and satisfaction.

### The Core Problem

When a GM asks players to make Intelligence checks to solve riddles, "the player has been excluded from participating."

### Solutions Without Spoiling the Fun

1. **Make riddles non-essential** — Ensure multiple paths around puzzles using the Three Clue Rule.
2. **Roll for clues, not solutions** — Break puzzles into components and grant clues rather than answers.
3. **Deliver clues diegetically** — Characters can discover journals, research lore, or investigate puzzle surroundings.

## Running Portals

Justin Alexander offers practical guidance for handling magical portals.

### Establish Clear Portal Mechanics

Before players interact with a portal, determine its metaphysical rules. Alexander identifies four main portal types: portals that function like simple doorways, portals where objects become stuck upon partial entry, dangerous portals that sever anything pulled backward, and touch-activated portals that instantly transport objects.

### Use Portal Countdowns

When scouts enter portals, track time carefully. Rather than immediately describing what the scout encounters, remain with the waiting characters and note how many rounds pass before each additional character enters.

## Rolling Behind the Screen

Justin Alexander examines whether game masters should hide their dice rolls behind a screen or roll openly.

### Key Factors for Hidden vs. Open Rolls

**Convenience**: When using a GM screen, rolling behind it is often easier.

**Secrecy**: Many rolls generate information characters shouldn't immediately access.

**Dramatic Effect**: When players know exactly what number must be rolled, rolling openly creates suspense.

## Tipping Your Hand

Justin Alexander addresses how to gather important tactical information from players without revealing that a decision is suddenly critical.

### Key Solutions

1. **Respect explicit declarations** — If players state their character's location, honor it.
2. **Establish standard operating procedures** — For frequently-needed information like dungeon marching order.
3. **Lay false trails** — Ask for incidental details regularly, even when no threat exists.
4. **Misdirect with scene-painting** — Use positioning questions primarily for descriptive purposes.
5. **Vary consequences** — Design scenarios where proximity creates different outcomes.
6. **Disguise questions** — Embed location-gathering within mechanically significant queries.
7. **Anticipate early** — Ask positioning questions before danger appears.

## Enter... the Boss!

The fundamental challenge in RPG combat design is keeping boss encounters engaging when player characters can focus overwhelming firepower on a single target.

### The Core Solution

Delay the villain's entrance. Rather than starting combat with the boss present, the PCs initially engage with minions. After two or three rounds, the villain arrives dramatically.

### Three Key Benefits

**Memorable Moment:** The dramatic arrival creates a striking, vivid scene.

**Tactical Disruption:** PCs engaged with other enemies cannot easily concentrate their attacks.

**Psychological Impact:** Even if the boss dies quickly afterward, the "feel" of the encounter differs significantly.

## Quick Shots

Justin Alexander proposes "quick shots"—ultra-short RPG scenarios playable in 20-30 minutes—to make tabletop RPGs more accessible.

### The Problem

Alexander notes that RPGs lack a "casual dip" opportunity. Trying a new RPG feels like a big commitment.

### Key Components for Quick Shots

**Rules Preparation:** Players need accessible rules through simplified mechanics or cheat sheets.

**Character Creation:** Fast generation methods work best.

**Scenario Design:** Effective quick shots feature "one complex scene with a specific goal or problem, but no prescribed solution."

# Scenario Structure Challenges

## Scenario Structure Challenge #1: Raiding the Death Star

Justin Alexander explores how to structure raid-type RPG scenarios using the Death Star infiltration from Star Wars as a model.

### Key Structural Elements

1. **Access**: How players enter the location
2. **Primary Obstacle**: What must be overcome to escape
3. **Objective**: What players want to accomplish
4. **Situational Obstacles**: Complications encountered along the way

### Raid Scenario Framework

- **Don't predetermine access methods**. Instead, identify all possible entry points and their security measures.
- **Sketch major facility features** with general spatial relationships rather than hyper-detailed maps.
- **Prepare 4-6 situational obstacles** including notable antagonists, interchangeable enemy units, and passive security systems.
- **Include 1-2 intermediate locations** between entry and objectives.

## Scenario Structure Challenge #4: Heists

Justin Alexander presents a comprehensive framework for running heist scenarios, drawing inspiration from Ocean's 11.

### The Five-Step Heist Structure

**Step 1: Identify the Score**
The target emerges organically or through patron hiring.

**Step 2: Gather Information**
Players must acquire blueprints, defensive measures, and event schedules. "90% of the fun in a heist scenario comes from seeing a problem and coming up with a solution."

**Step 3: Onsite Surveillance**
Before executing the heist, players conduct reconnaissance.

**Step 4: Prep Work**
Teams modify gathered information through reconnaissance.

**Step 5: The Operation**
Execution involves skill checks, complications, and potential gotchas. Failed checks generate complications rather than immediate plan failure.

### Critical Distinctions

Unlike location-crawls, heists require advance knowledge of layouts and defenses. The GM should avoid "twists of any type that automatically scuttle the entire job."

## Scenario Structure Challenge #5: The RPG Montage

Justin Alexander explores how film montage techniques can be adapted for tabletop RPGs.

### The Player-Led Montage

The foundational technique inverts typical scene framing. Rather than the GM controlling the narrative flow, players frame individual micro-scenes within the montage.

**Structure:**
- GM prompts preparation scenes
- Players declare specific actions
- GM presents locations and prompts execution methods
- Quick mechanical resolutions determine outcomes

### The Investigative Montage

This GM-led approach works when the choice to investigate is already established. The GM presents a **montage revelations list**—key information the party needs to discover—rather than specific clues.

### Core Principle

Any effective montage requires **overarching narrative purpose**—a unifying question the entire sequence answers.
