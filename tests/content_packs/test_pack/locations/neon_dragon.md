# The Neon Dragon

A notorious dive bar in the undercity, known for its cheap synth-whiskey and even cheaper information. The Neon Dragon has been a fixture of the underground scene for over two decades.

## Atmosphere

The bar is a cramped, low-ceilinged space thick with vaporizer smoke and the hum of outdated neon signs. Holographic fish swim lazily across the ceiling panels, most of them glitching. The bartender, a chrome-armed veteran named Sal, serves drinks in chipped ceramic mugs. The air smells of ozone, stale beer, and something chemical that nobody asks about.

## Regular Crowd

The Dragon attracts a specific clientele: fixers looking for new talent, couriers killing time between jobs, and the occasional corporate slummer pretending to be edgy. On any given night you might find data brokers swapping encrypted chips, street docs advertising under-the-table augmentation work, or hired muscle nursing drinks while they wait for calls.

## Back Room

Behind a beaded curtain at the rear of the bar lies a private room that Sal rents by the hour. No cameras, no recording devices, and Sal personally sweeps it for bugs twice a day. Most of the real business at the Dragon happens here — handoffs, negotiations, the occasional interrogation conducted quietly enough that the music covers it.
