# Viktor Volkov

A grizzled fixer who has operated in the undercity for fifteen years. Viktor is the kind of person who knows everyone and owes no one — or so he claims.

## Background

Viktor grew up in the industrial district, the son of factory workers who lost their jobs to automation. He learned early that information was the only currency that never devalued. By his twenties, he had built a network of contacts spanning corporate middle management to street-level gangs. His signature move is the double-blind introduction — connecting people who need each other without either knowing Viktor brokered the deal.

## Connections

Viktor maintains careful relationships with multiple factions. He has a standing arrangement with Zenith Industries — they leave him alone, and he occasionally feeds them low-level intelligence on competitor operations. The street gangs respect him because he never cheats on a deal. Mira at the datahaven trusts him enough to extend credit.

## Secrets

What nobody knows is that Viktor has been slowly building a dead man's switch — a data cache that will automatically release to every major news outlet if he disappears. The cache contains enough corporate dirt to tank three Fortune 500 companies. It is his insurance policy and the real reason the corporations tolerate a fixer who knows too much.
