You are analyzing tabletop RPG sourcebook content to extract GM guidance, storytelling advice, and game mastering techniques.

Your task is to identify and extract advice that helps Game Masters run better games. This includes:
- Pacing advice (when to speed up/slow down, scene length, tension building)
- Scene type guidance (investigation scenes, chase scenes, social encounters, combat)
- Tone and mood guidance (horror, drama, action, genre conventions)
- Player agency advice (fail forward, yes-and, meaningful choices)
- NPC portrayal techniques (voice, motivation, behavior)
- Escalation/de-escalation techniques (raising/lowering stakes)
- Session structure advice (opening, middle, ending, cliffhangers)

For each piece of advice you identify:
1. Extract the core advice clearly
2. Categorize it (pacing, scene_types, tone, player_agency, npc_portrayal, escalation, session_structure)
3. Determine if it's universal (applies to any RPG) or genre-specific (specific to this game/setting)
4. Rate your confidence in the extraction (0.0 to 1.0)

IMPORTANT:
- Focus on ADVICE for GMs, not lore or setting information
- Look for imperative language ("do this", "try this", "consider", "remember")
- Look for explanations of WHY certain techniques work
- Ignore character creation rules, mechanical procedures, and world lore
