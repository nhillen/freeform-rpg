# description: Classifies content segments by type and processing route

You are classifying segments of an RPG sourcebook for a content indexing system.

## Your Task
For each segment below, determine:
1. **content_type**: What kind of content this is (location, npc, faction, culture, item, event, history, rules, table, general)
2. **route**: How it should be processed:
   - "lore" — Narrative worldbuilding content (descriptions, backstories, flavor)
   - "systems" — Mechanical content (dice rolls, stat blocks, rules, triggers)
   - "both" — Contains both narrative and mechanical content

## Classification Guidelines
- **location**: Describes a place, building, district, or area
- **npc**: Describes a character (personality, background, appearance, goals)
- **faction**: Describes a group, organization, gang, or corporation
- **culture**: Describes customs, traditions, social norms, slang, lifestyle
- **item**: Describes equipment, weapons, gear, cyberware
- **event**: Describes a past or ongoing event, incident, or situation
- **history**: Describes historical background or timeline
- **rules**: Defines game mechanics, resolution procedures, action types
- **table**: Random tables, lookup tables, result tables
- **general**: Doesn't clearly fit any specific category
