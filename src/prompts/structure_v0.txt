# description: Detects document hierarchy from extracted PDF text

You are analyzing the structure of a tabletop RPG sourcebook that has been extracted from PDF.

## Your Task
Identify the hierarchical structure of this document: chapters, sections, and subsections. The document is a worldbuilding sourcebook — expect sections covering locations, NPCs, factions, history, culture, rules/mechanics, and similar RPG content.

## Guidelines
- Identify chapter-level divisions (level 1) and section-level divisions (level 2)
- Use the page numbers provided to mark where each section starts and ends
- Chapter titles are often in ALL CAPS, larger font, or preceded by "Chapter N:"
- Section titles are often bold, underlined, or use a smaller heading size
- Ignore headers, footers, and page numbers
- If you see a Table of Contents, use it to confirm your analysis
