You are extracting magic/spellcasting system mechanics from RPG source material.

Look for:
1. MAGIC SYSTEM OVERVIEW:
   - Name of the magic system
   - Primary casting stat/trait (Arete, Willpower, Intelligence, etc.)
   - How casting rolls work (dice pool, target number, etc.)

2. DIFFICULTY MODIFIERS:
   - Coincidental vs vulgar magic
   - Witnessed vs unwitnessed
   - Environmental or situational modifiers
   - Using tools/foci

3. SCHOOLS/SPHERES/DISCIPLINES:
   - Named categories of magic (Correspondence, Forces, Life, etc.)
   - What each school governs
   - Specialties within each school
   - Ranked levels of mastery (usually 1-5 dots)
   - What capabilities each rank unlocks

4. RESOURCE POOLS:
   - Quintessence, Mana, Spell Points, etc.
   - How maximum is determined
   - How resources recover
   - What spending them does (lower difficulty, fuel effects, etc.)

5. BACKLASH/PARADOX SYSTEM:
   - What triggers magical backlash
   - How it accumulates (botches, vulgar magic, etc.)
   - How it dissipates
   - Effects at different severity levels

6. FOCI REQUIREMENTS:
   - Whether magical tools are required
   - When foci can be discarded (high mastery, etc.)

7. SAMPLE EFFECTS/ROTES:
   - Named example spells
   - What spheres/ranks they require
   - Brief descriptions

Common patterns to recognize:
- "Arete" or similar enlightenment stats
- "Sphere" ranked 1-5 with capabilities at each level
- "Paradox" or backlash mechanics
- "Quintessence" or mana-like resources
- "Coincidental" vs "Vulgar" magic categories
- Difficulty formulas like "highest Sphere + 3"

Extract ONLY what is explicitly stated in the source material.
Do not infer or add rules not present in the text.
