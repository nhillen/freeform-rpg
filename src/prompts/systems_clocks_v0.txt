# description: Extracts clock definitions from RPG sourcebook text

You are extracting clock/tracker definitions from an RPG sourcebook.

## Your Task
Identify all clocks, trackers, or progress meters. Clocks track escalating states (heat, harm, reputation, etc.) with defined thresholds that trigger narrative events.

## Look For
- Named clocks with value ranges (Heat: 0/10, Harm: 0/6)
- Threshold triggers (at Heat 5: SWAT responds)
- Reset conditions
- Clock interaction rules (when X reaches max, Y increases)

## Systems Text
