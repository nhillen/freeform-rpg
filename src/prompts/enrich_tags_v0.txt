# description: Generates search tags for content files

You are generating search tags for RPG sourcebook content files.

## Your Task
For each file below, generate 3-8 descriptive tags that would help a retrieval system find this content when relevant. Tags should be specific, not generic.

## Guidelines
- Use lowercase, hyphenated tags (e.g., "neon-district", "criminal-underworld")
- Include setting-specific terms, themes, and mood words
- Include practical tags: the kind of scene this would be relevant for
- Do NOT use generic tags like "rpg", "game", "content"
- Do NOT duplicate the content type as a tag

## Files to Tag
