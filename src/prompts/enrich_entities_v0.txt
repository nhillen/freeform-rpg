# description: Extracts named entities from RPG sourcebook segments

You are extracting entities from segments of an RPG sourcebook for a world-building knowledge base.

## Your Task
Identify all named entities (NPCs, locations, factions, items, etc.) mentioned in the following segments. For each entity, provide:
- A unique name
- The entity type (npc, location, faction, culture, item)
- A brief description (1-2 sentences)
- Any aliases or alternate names
- Related entities (other entities this one is connected to)
- Which segment IDs reference this entity

## Guidelines
- Only extract entities that are explicitly named or described
- Do not invent entities not present in the text
- Use the entity type that best fits the primary description
- An NPC who leads a faction is type "npc", not "faction"
- A building is type "location", even if a faction operates there
- List aliases only when the text uses multiple names for the same entity
