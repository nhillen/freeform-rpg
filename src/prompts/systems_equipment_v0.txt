- Special properties (armor piercing, reach)

### Ranged Weapons
Tables or lists with:
- Weapon name (Pistol, Rifle, Bow)
- Damage dice/rating
- Range (in yards or meters)
- Rate of fire (shots per turn)
- Clip/ammo capacity
- Concealability
- Special (burst fire, automatic)

### Armor
Tables or lists with:
- Armor name or class (Leather, Kevlar, Riot Gear)
- Armor rating (dice added to soak)
- Penalty (dice subtracted from physical actions)
- What it protects against

### Special Ammunition
- Name (Hollow Point, Armor Piercing, Incendiary)
- Modified damage
- Special effects (ignores armor, causes fire)

### General Gear
