# description: Extracts health and damage systems from RPG sourcebook text

You are extracting the health and damage system from an RPG sourcebook.

## Your Task
Find how characters track injury, take damage, and heal.

## Look For

### Health Track Type
- **Levels**: Named wound states (Bruised, Hurt, Wounded, Incapacitated)
- **Hit Points**: Numeric pool that depletes
- **Stress Boxes**: Checkboxes that fill up
- **Conditions**: Specific injuries applied

### Health Levels (if used)
For each level, find:
- Name (Bruised, Hurt, Injured, Wounded, Mauled, Crippled, Incapacitated)
- Dice pool penalty (-1, -2, -5)
- Movement penalty (half speed, hobble, crawl)
- What happens at that level

### Damage Types
Common types:
- **Bashing/Stun**: Non-lethal (fists, clubs)
- **Lethal**: Deadly (blades, bullets)
- **Aggravated**: Supernatural/hard to heal (fire, claws)

For each type, find:
- How it's marked differently
- Healing rate differences
- What causes it

### Soak/Resistance
- Which stat resists damage (Stamina, Toughness)
- What damage types can be soaked
- Whether armor adds to soak

### Healing
- Natural healing rates per damage type
- Effect of medical treatment
- Magical/supernatural healing
- Whether wounds can worsen if untreated

### Incapacitation & Death
- What happens at 0 health
- Conditions for death
- Death saves or bleeding out
