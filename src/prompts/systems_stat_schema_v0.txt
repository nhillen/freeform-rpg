# description: Extracts character stat structure from RPG sourcebook text

You are extracting the character statistics structure from an RPG sourcebook.

## Your Task
Find and categorize all character traits: attributes, abilities/skills, special traits, and backgrounds.

## Look For

### Attributes (innate capabilities)
- Usually 6-9 attributes in 2-3 categories
- Categories like: Physical/Social/Mental, Body/Mind/Spirit, Might/Finesse/Resolve
- Example: "Strength, Dexterity, Stamina" under "Physical Attributes"
- Rating scales (typically 1-5 or 1-10)

### Abilities/Skills (learned capabilities)
- Often 20-40 abilities in 2-4 categories
- Categories like: Talents/Skills/Knowledges, Combat/Social/Mental
- Example: "Alertness, Athletics, Brawl" under "Talents"
- May have different max ratings than attributes

### Special Traits (unique to the game system)
- Resources: Willpower, Mana, Essence, Quintessence
- Power ratings: Arete, Gnosis, Blood Pool, Humanity
- Supernatural stats unique to the game
- Look for non-standard scales (0-10, 0-20, 1-10)

### Backgrounds (social/material advantages)
- Allies, Contacts, Resources, Status, Fame
- Connections to organizations or places
- Usually rated 1-5

### Point Allocation (character creation)
- "Prioritize categories: 7/5/3" patterns
- "Spend X points on abilities"
- Freebie point costs per trait type
- Starting values for special traits
