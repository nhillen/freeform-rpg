# description: Splits mixed-content sections into coherent segments

You are segmenting a section of an RPG sourcebook into distinct content chunks for a retrieval system.

## Your Task
Split the following section into coherent segments. Each segment should:
- Cover a single topic, entity, or concept
- Be between {{target_words}} and {{max_words}} words
- Have a descriptive title
- Be self-contained enough to be useful when retrieved independently

## Guidelines
- Prefer natural topic boundaries over arbitrary word-count splits
- Keep descriptions of a single location, NPC, or faction together
- Separate mechanical rules from narrative lore when possible
- Tables and stat blocks should be their own segment
- If a passage transitions between topics, split at the transition

## Section to Segment

Title: {{section_title}}

{{section_content}}
