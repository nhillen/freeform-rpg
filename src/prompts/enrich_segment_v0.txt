# description: Generates enriched frontmatter for a content segment

You are preparing an RPG sourcebook segment for a structured knowledge base.

## Your Task
Given a content segment and a list of known entities, generate enriched YAML frontmatter that will help the retrieval system find and contextualize this content.

## Current Segment
Title: {{title}}
Content Type: {{content_type}}

Content:
{{content}}

## Known Entities
{{known_entities}}

## Current Frontmatter
{{current_frontmatter}}

## Guidelines
- Preserve the existing frontmatter fields, updating where you have better information
- Add entity_refs for any known entities mentioned or implied in the content
- The title should be descriptive but concise
- Tags should be specific and useful for search (e.g., "underground", "criminal", "neon-district")
- entity_id should be a snake_case identifier derived from the title
