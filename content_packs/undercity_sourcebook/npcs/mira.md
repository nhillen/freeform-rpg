# Mira

Information broker and owner of DataHaven Cafe. Mira's augmented eyes — custom jobs with chrome irises that shift color based on data throughput — are her signature. She speaks in clipped, fragmented sentences, a side effect of processing multiple data streams simultaneously through her neural implants.

## Profile

Mira grew up in the Undercity and learned early that information is the only currency that never devalues. She started as a data sniffer, pulling scraps of corporate traffic from poorly shielded fiber lines. By twenty she was brokering mid-tier secrets. By twenty-five she'd built DataHaven.

She is fiercely independent and trusts no one completely — not Viktor, not her regulars, and certainly not anyone wearing a corporate badge. Her prices are high but her data is reliable. She has a reputation for never selling the same exclusive twice, which makes her sources willing to come back.

Her relationship with Viktor is professional and cautiously respectful. They trade favors and information, each knowing the other could cause serious problems if the relationship soured. Mira privately considers Viktor sentimental — a liability in their line of work — but values his network.

## What She Knows

Mira has intercepted chatter suggesting Zenith Industries lost something valuable and is deploying field assets to recover it. She doesn't know it's a neural override controller, but she knows the corporate response is disproportionate to a standard data theft. That means either the data itself is weapon-grade, or it exposes something Zenith can't afford to have public.

She can identify Agent Chen from surveillance footage if shown a description or image. She's seen corporate security operatives before and can provide tactical advice on their standard operating procedures — for a price.

She also knows that someone has been asking about couriers in the last forty-eight hours. Not corporate — someone else. She hasn't identified who yet, but the queries came through channels that suggest organized crime interest.
