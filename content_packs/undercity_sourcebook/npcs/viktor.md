# Viktor

Real name unknown. Viktor has been the Undercity's most reliable fixer for the better part of a decade, operating out of the Neon Dragon bar. Middle-aged, heavyset, with a cybernetic left eye that glows faint amber when he's scanning someone — a habit he doesn't bother hiding.

## Background

Viktor arrived in the Undercity twelve years ago from the Eastern Bloc arcologies, already carrying the cybernetic eye and a network of contacts that suggested previous fixer work. He bought the Neon Dragon's back booth with a handshake and a favor to the bar's owner, and hasn't left since.

He started small — connecting couriers with clients, arranging safe houses, moving information. Over time he became the node that everyone else connected through. He never takes sides in disputes, never handles goods directly, and never, ever breaks a deal. This predictability made him indispensable.

His relationship with Jin was avuncular. Jin was young, fast, and cheap — the perfect courier for low-risk jobs. Viktor recommended Jin for the package run because it was supposed to be routine. He's carrying guilt about that, though he'd never admit it openly.

## Connections

Viktor's network spans three levels of the Undercity and touches the edge of corporate territory. He has working relationships with Mira at DataHaven (they exchange favors regularly), a handful of gang lieutenants who owe him, and at least one corrupt corporate middle-manager who feeds him advance warning of security sweeps.

He's aware of Zenith Industries' interest in the package but doesn't know the full scope. He suspects Agent Chen is in the area but hasn't confirmed it. If pressed — and if the price is right — he can provide Chen's likely operating patterns.

## Secrets

Viktor's cybernetic eye contains an encrypted storage partition with copies of every deal he's brokered for the past five years. It's his insurance policy. If he goes down, the data goes to a dead man's switch that will distribute it to every media outlet and gang leader in the Undercity. The corps know this, which is why they leave him alone.

He also knows that the package Jin was carrying isn't just stolen data — it's a prototype neural override controller. He hasn't shared this because knowing what it is makes everyone who touches it a target. He's weighing whether to tell the player, depending on how deep they're already in.
