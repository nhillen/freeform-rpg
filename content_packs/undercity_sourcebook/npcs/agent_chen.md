# Agent Chen

Corporate security operative deployed by Zenith Industries' Asset Recovery Division. Chen operates under a sanitized cover identity and carries credentials that give her authority over local law enforcement in corporate-adjacent districts. In the Undercity, those credentials mean less, but the sidearm on her hip speaks a more universal language.

## Operational Profile

Chen is methodical, patient, and well-trained. She follows Zenith's rules of engagement, which prioritize asset recovery over body count — but those rules have generous interpretations when field conditions warrant it. She prefers surveillance and pressure over direct confrontation, building a picture of her target's network before moving in.

She arrived in the district six hours after Jin missed his check-in with Zenith's monitoring systems. Yes — Zenith was tracking the package through Jin's neural implant. They didn't kill him. Someone else got to him first, and that makes Chen's job harder and her mood worse.

Her current objective is threefold: locate the package, identify who intercepted it, and ensure no copies of the data exist. She has authorization to use lethal force only as a last resort, but "last resort" in Zenith's policy manual has a flexible definition.

## Methods

Chen is working alone, which is unusual for a Zenith field op. This suggests either the operation is classified above normal channels, or Zenith is testing her for promotion. She has access to the district's commercial surveillance network through a corporate data-sharing agreement, giving her camera feeds from shops, transit stations, and building lobbies — but not private residences or establishments like the Neon Dragon that have opted out.

She's been running facial recognition on known couriers and their associates. If the player has been caught on any commercial cameras since Jin's death, Chen may already have their face flagged.

## Vulnerabilities

Chen operates solo. She has no backup closer than twenty minutes away. She follows protocol, which makes her predictable to anyone who understands corporate security doctrine. She doesn't know the Undercity well — she's relying on maps and surveillance rather than local knowledge. A runner with good streetwise could lose her in the maintenance corridors or the market warrens.
