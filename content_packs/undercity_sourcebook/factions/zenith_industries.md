# Zenith Industries

A tier-two megacorporation specializing in neural interface technology, bioware research, and what their annual report euphemistically calls "cognitive security solutions." Zenith occupies three floors of the Apex Tower in the Upper City and maintains research facilities in the orbital stations.

## Corporate Profile

Zenith's public face is consumer neural implants — the interfaces that let ordinary citizens access AR overlays, run personal assistants, and connect to the net. Market share sits around eighteen percent, making them the third-largest neural tech provider. Profitable but not dominant. The kind of company that needs an edge to survive against the tier-one players.

That edge is their classified research division, internally designated "Project Threshold." Threshold develops neural override technology — the ability to remotely influence, control, or disable neural implants. The military applications are obvious. The civilian applications are worse. Zenith has been shopping Threshold tech to government contracts while publicly lobbying against neural security regulations.

The package Jin was carrying contained a prototype Threshold controller and the associated research documentation. If this technology reaches the public or a competitor, Zenith's stock price collapses and several executives face criminal prosecution under the Neural Autonomy Accords.

## Undercity Operations

Zenith has no permanent presence in the Undercity. They consider it beneath their operational threshold and typically delegate any Undercity activity to contracted security firms. Agent Chen's direct deployment signals how seriously they're taking this recovery operation.

The corporation's relationship with the Undercity is parasitic but indirect. Zenith's factories employ Undercity residents at subsistence wages. Their consumer implants are the most common hardware in the lower levels — cheap, reliable, and quietly collecting usage data that Zenith sells to advertising networks.
