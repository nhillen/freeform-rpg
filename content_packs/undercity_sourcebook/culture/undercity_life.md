# Undercity Life

The Undercity sprawls beneath the elevated platforms and skyways of the corporate districts. Officially, it's Levels 1 through 5 of the city's vertical structure — the foundation that everything else was built on top of and then forgotten. Unofficially, it's home to about two million people who the Upper City pretends don't exist.

## Daily Existence

Life in the Undercity runs on a different clock. The artificial lighting cycles approximate day and night but nobody pays much attention. Shift work at the factories and recycling plants dictates the real schedule. When the factory hooters sound, the noodle stands open and the bars fill up. When the next shift starts, the streets empty.

Currency is cred — digital, anonymous, loaded onto credsticks. Paper money doesn't exist. Barter fills the gaps where cred doesn't reach. A favor owed is worth more than cred in the right circumstances, and the economy of favors is the Undercity's real financial system.

Housing ranges from converted shipping containers to carved-out sections of the old subway system. Rent is cheap by Upper City standards but still eats most of a factory wage. Squatting is common and tolerated as long as you don't block maintenance access to the infrastructure.

## Street Culture and Slang

Runners call quick jobs "burns" and long ones "soaks." Getting paid is "clicking" (from credstick transactions). Getting caught is "getting tagged." Corporate security are "chrome" or "suits." The cops — what few patrol the Undercity — are "static" because they mostly just stand around.

A "ghost" is someone who's gone off-grid entirely, no implants, no net presence. Rare and respected. A "loud" is someone who attracts too much attention. Being loud gets you shunned or worse.

The greeting between runners is a quick tap of knuckles — right hand only, left hand stays free. Refusing the tap is a declaration of distrust. Offering it to a stranger is an invitation to talk business.
