# DataHaven Cafe

A basement-level establishment two blocks east of the Neon Dragon, accessible through an unmarked door behind a laundromat. DataHaven bills itself as a cafe, but the coffee is an afterthought. The real product is information — bought, sold, and brokered across encrypted terminals in semi-private booths.

## Layout and Atmosphere

The main room is a low-ceilinged space lit almost entirely by the glow of screens. A dozen booths line the walls, each equipped with a hardwired terminal and a privacy screen that blocks visual surveillance. The center of the room holds a communal table where newcomers and small-time buyers sit, visible to everyone — a deliberate design choice that tells regulars exactly who doesn't belong.

The air hums with server fans and cooling systems. A faint ozone smell lingers from overclocked hardware somewhere behind the walls. The coffee machine dispenses exactly one variety of black stimulant that tastes like burnt circuitry but keeps you sharp for hours.

Mira runs DataHaven from the back booth — the only one with its own power supply and a dead switch that can wipe every terminal in the room in under three seconds. She built the place five years ago with money from a corporate data breach she brokered. The corps never traced it back to her.

## Rules of Engagement

DataHaven operates on reputation. First-timers pay double and get watched. Regulars get fair rates and discretion. Burn a source, share something you bought exclusively, or bring corporate heat to the door, and you're banned permanently. Mira enforces this through a network of contacts who will quietly make life difficult for anyone on her blacklist.

Physical violence inside DataHaven is met with an immediate lockdown — blast doors seal the entrance, and the ventilation system can pump in incapacitating gas. Mira has never had to use the gas. The blast doors have been enough.
