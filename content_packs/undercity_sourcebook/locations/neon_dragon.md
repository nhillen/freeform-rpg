# The Neon Dragon

A dive bar in the Undercity's Level 3 corridor, wedged between a body-mod clinic and a defunct ramen stand. The Neon Dragon has been neutral ground for fixers, runners, and the desperate for over twenty years. Its neon sign — a coiling dragon breathing pixelated fire — has been broken since before anyone can remember. Only the "eon Drag" still lights up on most nights.

## Atmosphere

The air inside the Dragon is thick with synth-smoke and the low throb of bass from speakers that have seen better decades. Red and blue neon tubes line the ceiling, casting everyone in bruise-colored light. The bar top is real wood — salvaged from a demolished church, according to Viktor — scarred with knife marks and the burns of a thousand forgotten cigarettes.

The crowd runs quiet most nights. Couriers waiting for pings, off-shift factory workers nursing cheap synth-whiskey, the occasional corporate slummer trying to look inconspicuous and failing. Nobody makes eye contact for longer than necessary. The bartender, a silent augmented woman named Lina, keeps a sawed-off under the counter and has used it twice in the last year. Both times the mess was cleaned up before the next shift.

The synth music cycles through the same forty tracks. Sometimes the jukebox glitches and plays fragments of pre-war jazz. Nobody knows why. The regulars prefer it.

## Regular Crowd

The Dragon's regulars form a loose ecosystem. Viktor holds court in the back booth most evenings, nursing a drink that never seems to empty. Couriers drift in and out — Jin was one of them before he turned up dead. A handful of retired runners occupy the corner stools, trading stories that grow more elaborate with each telling.

There's an unspoken code: no weapons drawn inside, debts settled outside, and if someone walks in bleeding, Lina patches them up and asks no questions. Corporate security knows about the Dragon but considers it beneath their attention — which is exactly how Viktor wants it.

Local gangs respect the neutrality because Viktor has leverage on all of them. Break the peace in his bar, and suddenly your supply chain has problems.

## The Back Room

Behind a bead curtain and past the restrooms, a narrow corridor leads to what Viktor calls "the office." It's a storage room with a reinforced door, a table, two chairs, and signal-dampening wallpaper that blocks all wireless traffic. Deals that need privacy happen here. The room has one rule: no recordings.

Viktor keeps a lockbox under the floorboards. He says it's empty. Nobody has tested that claim.

The back exit opens onto the alley — the same alley where Jin's body was found. Viktor swears he heard nothing that night, but the walls are thick and the music was loud.
