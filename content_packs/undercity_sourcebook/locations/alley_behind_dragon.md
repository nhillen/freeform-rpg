# Alley Behind the Dragon

A narrow service alley connecting the Neon Dragon's back exit to the Level 3 maintenance corridor. The alley runs about forty meters, hemmed in by featureless concrete walls stained with decades of condensation runoff. Overhead pipes drip warm water that smells faintly of recycled coolant.

## Crime Scene Details

The body was found slumped against the east wall, roughly ten meters from the Dragon's back door. Jin's cheap cybernetics were still sparking when the first person stumbled out for a smoke break. The positioning suggests he was walking toward the bar — coming from the maintenance corridor end — when he went down.

No signs of a struggle. No defensive wounds. Neural overload is clean and fast if you have the right rig. The attacker either had military-grade intrusion hardware or was very, very good with civilian tools. Either way, this wasn't a mugging. Muggers use knives and threats, not neural exploits.

The rain has washed away most trace evidence, but the alley's drainage grate was clogged with debris. A thorough search of the grate might turn up something the water carried downstream.

## Surroundings

A rusted fire escape climbs the east wall to the rooftops — the rungs are slick but holdable. Two dumpsters sit near the Dragon's door, one overflowing with kitchen waste. A surveillance camera at the alley's north entrance was disabled weeks ago and never repaired. The maintenance corridor end has a functioning camera, but it's owned by the building management company, not the city.

The alley gets foot traffic during shift changes at the factory next door, but between midnight and six it's deserted. Jin was found around 22:45, during a gap in the crowd.
